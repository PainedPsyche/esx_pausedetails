# esx_pausedetails
A simple script that controls information displayed in the pause menu title and upper-right header.

## Basic information
By default the header will display:

* first row: `player name` (`character name` when using esx_identity), followed by `job` and `job grade`
* second row: unchanged (data provided by the client: in-game `day` and `hour`)
* third row: esx account balances (`cash`, `bank` and `dirty money`)
